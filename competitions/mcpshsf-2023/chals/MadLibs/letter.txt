Dear Diary,

I can't believe how upset I am right now. I asked Chance for some Latkes and he never responded! I was really looking forward to enjoying those crispy, delicious potato pancakes, and I was practically salivating at the thought of smothering them with sour cream and applesauce.

Now, I'm sitting here in my kitchen, feeling sorry for myself, and hungry as can be. I can't stop thinking about those latkes, and how amazing they would have tasted if only I had been able to get my hands on some potatoes. It's not fair, really. I mean, who runs out of latkes?

I know it's silly to get so worked up over something as simple as food, but I can't help it. I was really looking forward to those latkes, and now I'm just mad that I didn't get to enjoy them. 

I guess I'll just sulk in my room and try to forget about those delicious, crispy latkes that I missed out on. I might have to hit something if I don't get those latkes.
