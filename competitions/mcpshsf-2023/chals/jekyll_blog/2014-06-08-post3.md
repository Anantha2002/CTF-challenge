Hey all! So I encrypted some important info, but I can't get the key ;(. I locked the key with a bike lock and I don't know the combination. Can anyone help me out? The information is below, I think I used some sort of Advanced Encryption Algorithm.

Visit the HT230 Lab with the secret code "potatoes" to get access to a bike lock (everyone must be present).
