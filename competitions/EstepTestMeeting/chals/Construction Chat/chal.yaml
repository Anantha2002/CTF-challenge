    - name: "Educator1"
      messages: ["Yes, BossMan. The roofing material we've been using contains toxic chemicals that emit a strong odor. Prolonged exposure to these chemicals can have negative effects on the health of our students."]

      messages: ["I understand your concern, but we need to get the job done. Can't we just provide our students with masks or something to protect them?"]
    - name: "Educator1"
      messages: ["Masks may provide some level of protection, but they are not a solution to the problem. The odor is a clear indication that the chemicals are being released into the air, which means that the students are still being exposed to them. In addition, the odor itself can cause nausea and headaches, which can affect the productivity and well-being of our students."]

The negative effects of prolonged exposure to these toxic chemicals can be serious and long-lasting. As a responsible institution, it is our duty to provide a safe learning environment for our students."]

    - name: "Educator1"
      messages: ["Yes, I can recommend several roofing materials that are free from toxic chemicals and do not emit strong odors. I will provide you with a list of options, and we can discuss which one would be the best fit for our project."]
