This assignment will help you explore three concepts:
  1.  Writing a binary search (with ArrayList)
  2.  Consider why the amount of time is not consistent
  3.  Compare the performance of a sequential and a binary search

TODO:
  1.  complete your binary search method
  2.  choose three target words...relatively random, 
      but one near the beginning, one near the middle, 
      and one near the end of the alphabet.
  3.  Test each word 3 times..each time recording how long the Sequential and Binary searches took.

NAME: (your name here)
Record your data here: (change the words and change the data!)
Sort          "amount"     "middle"      "zippy"
Sequential    3, 5, 7       9, 1, 34      87, 2, 6
Binary        2,3,4         5,6,7         8,9,10

  4.  What pattern or relationship do you see?
